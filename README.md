# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
In the digital age, credit card fraud is becoming more and more common. Criminals are using new ways of stealing credit card data and making unauthorized purchases as a result of the 
increase in online shopping and electronic payment systems. The financial and personal impact of credit card frauds can be significant, which is why it is important to identify and 
prevent them in the first place. To identify fraud with credit cards, we intend to analyze a wide variety of features of the transaction including card number, CVV, expiry date, repeat 
retailers, used chip and PIN as well as online order history using machine intelligence techniques. In order to avoid financial losses on both the part of individuals and a financial 
institution, it is aimed at developing an accurately and effective model that can spot fraud in real time

**### OBJECTIVES**
- To detect fraudulent activities in credit card transactions and predict the result.
- Compare some efficient machine learning algorithms, find better accuracy, and suggest a model.
- Visualize dataset through model graphs using Python libraries.
- Integrate machine learning model in the web-based framework for better user interface and user experience.
- To develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud.
- To integrate the selected machine learning model with the Streamlit web framework to create a user-friendly and interactive interface for fraud detection.
- To provide a reliable and secure fraud detection system that can be deployed to production environments such as web servers or mobile applications.
- To improve the performance of the model using techniques such as oversampling or undersampling, ensemble learning, or hyperparameter tuning.
- To comply with data protection laws and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to ensure 
the privacy and security of the data used for training and testing the model.
- To evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score and identify areas for improvement.
- To provide a solution that can be easily maintained and updated as new data and techniques become available.
- To increase the efficiency and speed of the fraud detection process, thus reducing the time taken to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.
- To reduce financial losses for individuals and companies that fall victim to credit card fraud.
- To contribute to the advancement of machine learning and data science techniques for fraud detection and prevention.
- To provide a useful tool for financial institutions, merchants, and individuals to monitor their credit card transactions and prevent fraudulent activities.
- To increase awareness about the prevalence of credit card fraud and the importance of using advanced technology to prevent it.

## ABSTRACT

In this paper, a general term for both fraud and theft committed with or while using a credit card for payment is "credit card fraud." In light of the daily increase in scammers, numerous different types of fraud are committed using credit cards. In order to address this issue, numerous methods like logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, and Naive Bayes algorithms are used. Various options are considered for this transaction, and the best one is implemented. Filtering out the above-mentioned tactics is done mostly to achieve the goal of detecting fraud and producing better results. Credit card fraud has increased due to the growing popularity of using credit cards for online purchases. The problem has been addressed through the use of machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions made with credit cards. In this paper, suggesting a system for detecting credit card fraud that employs machine learning techniques to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. In order to examine previous transaction data and spot trends that point to fraudulent activity, the proposed system combines both supervised and unsupervised methods of learning. Additionally combining the developed machine learning methods with a web-based platform to deliver an intuitive user interface for immediate form of fraud detection. The test findings demonstrate that the suggested framework detects fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy and with a minimal amount of false positives.
